# LAB: ES6 Classes

In this lab, you will be doing your first "refactoring", which the process of migrating working code into a new methodology or tech stack. Today, you'll migrate a standard constructor function exported from a node module into a Class, keeping the functionality (and the interface) exactly the same.

## Getting Started

Fork the [Online REPL](https://repl.it/@codefellows/ES6-Classes){:target=_blank} for this assignment. Complete your work in the online editor

## Requirements

- Implement both `Car` and `Motorcycle` as Vehicles using only Javascript ES6 `Class{}` syntax

## Implementation Details

When running this REPL, you will see that there is some output that will show you that a Car and Motorcycle can be created properly using a Constructor Function and Prototype methods.

However, the Vehicles via ES6 Classes will cause errors, as it has not yet been implemented.

Your work will be done in the `vehicles-with-classes.js` file, which is setup to run the same methods on Car and Motorcycle classes as the "Constructor" version, with the expectation that you can produce identical output

- Using ES6 Classes and inheritance, replicate the behavior of the Vehicle, Car, and Motorcycle implementations
- Your output from this file should be exactly the same as the output from the other version (vehicles-with-constructor.js).
- Clicking the "run >" button will execute both versions
