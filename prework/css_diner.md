# CSS Diner

**If you are coming from a Code 201 class that ended within 2 weeks of the start of your Code 301 class**, consider redoing the assignment.

If you completed Code 201 more than 2 weeks prior to the start of Code 301, please complete this assignment as a way to keep your HTML/CSS skills sharp. 

If you are testing in to Code 301, you should know that students in Code 201 complete all levels of the [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/). This is your opportunity to take on that challenge.

[CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) takes you through different levels of CSS challenges. Once you have completed all the levels, take a screenshot that shows all the levels checked off and submit it.
