## Course Description

In this intensive course, you will study the common core of software development, including the MVC pattern, object-oriented and functional programming, and computer science fundamentals such as basic data structures and algorithms. Come learn how to create and deploy web apps in the “MERN” stack with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, with the help of third-party APIs and libraries from around the web.

## Program Learning Outcomes

Students will learn to write clean, well-tested, JavaScript and React code, integrate with remote APIs, and interface with MongoDB using industry best practices.
