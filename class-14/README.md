# DEI and 301 Final Exam

## Overview

We begin class with a discussion on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in technology. Take some time to think about what a diverse workplace and team would look like for you and what you think the benefits of that type of team would be.

The Code 301 final exam will become available during this class and is due at the end of 4 hours. This exam also serves as the Code 401 entrance exam. However, it is a pass/fail graded portion of this course, regardless of your intent to advance to a Code 401 course.

The exam is open book, open Google, open Stack Overflow, whatever resources you want to use, but it must be completed individually. You may not get help from anyone else, except from your instructor. The exam is designed to cover the full range of what was taught in this course. The intent is to measure not your memorization skills, but your resourcefulness and your ability to adapt and problem-solve. Give yourself adequate time for the exam.
